# MogiiBot3
MogiiBot3 is a Discord Bot, developed using the Discord.Net API wrapper. The Bot was originally developed for use on the MogiiCraft Discord Guild.

# Use of the code
You may use the code within the terms of the license. Unfortunately, I can not help you set up the Bot or give you a detailed tutorial on how to do so, but I can provide some pointers.

The code makes references to a library called ~~MelissasCode~~ MelissaNet. I will not be sharing this library therefore, if you decide to use my code, you will need to find all of these methods and variables and change them yourself.
